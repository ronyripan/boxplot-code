1. mathmatical code for boxplot 2. graphical representation of boxplot

Boxplot is a method for graphically depicting numerical data based on a five-number summary (minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum). 
Boxplot is widely used because it can tell about outliers and what their values are. The median value of the boxplot represents the median value of a certain feature. 
The first quartile represents the middle number between the smallest number (not the minimum number) and the median of a certain feature, the third quartile represents the middle number between the largest number (not the maximum number) and the median of a certain feature.
The range between the first quartile and third quartile is called the Interquartile range (IQR). The maximum value represents as (Q3 $ + $ 1.5 $ * $ IQR) and the Minimum value represents as (Q1 $ â€“ $ 1.5 $ * $ IQR). 
Any number outside all these ranges is called outlier.
